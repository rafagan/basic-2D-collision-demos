# Basic 2D collision demos
Some basic 2D examples of AABB VS AABB, AABB VS BoundingCircle and BoundingCircle VS BoundingCircle collision detection.

Made with OpenFrameworks and wrote in C/C++.
The collision algorithms were intentionally built with pure C code.

You can also see the implementation using collision with more C++ code here:
